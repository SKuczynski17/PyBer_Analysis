# Samuel Kuczynski PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this analysis was to help summarize and visualize data from our ride sharing partners at PyBer. We used multiple different modules within our Jupyter notebooks to help accomplish this task. We were able to calculate different metrics in each different city type. Then we were able to graph these results across January - April using Matplotlib.


## Results

### Throughout this analysis we were able to deduct that the highest fares of rides were in the Urban cities, followed by Suburban and lowest for Rural. Along with being the highest cost we also saw the most rides coming out of the Urban area, potentially causing this increase in price. Some statistical differences between each city type are listed below.

## Summary

### Three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing disparities among the city types

#### I would primarily focus on expanding the product in the Rural/Suburban areas, we can see how much growth the Urban areas help drive PyBer as a whole. If PyBer can help sell additional rides in these smaller cities, it could help grow the company exponentially. One way that they could do this is by offering cheaper rides initially in these towns to get the individuals to understand the benefits. Then as we gain customer ship we can revert to our typical pricing and hopefully retain these same customers. To help supplement the increased demand in these smaller areas of rides; we are going to need to have enough drivers to support this as well. So from an investment standpoint we can take a loss on some of these rides as we gain market share in these areas, ensuring that our drivers are supported and dedicated to working for us in these smaller areas.
